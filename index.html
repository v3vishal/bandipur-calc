                    In the 2019 fires that occurred in Bandipur, a lot of flora and fauna was affected by the colossal fires that damaged a huge amount of trees. <br>
The forest fire in 2019 of Bandipur led to a reduction in forest coverage of around <a href="https://ge.bujournals.com/articles/changes-of-land-use-land-cover-in-bandipur-national-park">3.46%</a> as per the difference in forest cover area in 2011 and 2019, which translates to an estimated reduction of 12 to 15 lakh trees over the total area of nearly 1400 sq. km of area, assuming around 100 fully grown trees (plus or minus) per acre.
<br> Here, to calculate the amount of Tigers that could have benefitted by the amount of trees lost, the following was done; <br> <br>
<li>As per the 10% law of energy transfer efficiency, with an assumption of 1000 Joules of energy absorption by a tree on 1,00,000 joules of sun energy that would fall on the surface of Earth, that translates to 1 Joule of energy transferred to a tiger, where the tiger is the tertiary consumer. With an estimated 5000 Joules of energy consumption for a tiger per day, this would mean that around 5000 trees would be needed to sustain the energy requirement of a tiger per day.</li>
<br>Therefore, a loss of 12 to 15 lakhs of trees would have indirectly (via the food chain) meant that the energy requirement for around 250 to 300 tigers would have been impacted.
<br><br>
Presently, we have very less number of tigers. The current extent of forestation and tree density is essential to maintain and sustain the current population. Any further reduction will not only create pressure on the existing ecosystem but also limit further expansion of the tiger population. Incidents like fire, leading to a depletion of tree density would hence be detrimental to wild life at large and in this case, tigers are the ones affected by this.
<h4>Invasive species across few trophic levels:</h4>
<li> <u>Plants</u>: Water hyacinth, Carrot grass, Siam weed, Wild tamarind, Black wattle, Mesquite, Lantana camara and Pogostemon benghalensis - these are a few invasive plants that can choke native species preventing energy transfer to next trophic level, i.e. Herbivores and top predators.</li>
<li> <u>Herbivores</u>:  The Yellow Crazy Ant species are one of the most invasive species, listed in the top 100 worst invaders in the world according to the Invasive Species Specialist Group. They are known to kill mammals, birds, reptiles and land crabs which again affect the food chain.</li>
These all together indirectly affect the tiger causing endangerment and ecological imbalance.
